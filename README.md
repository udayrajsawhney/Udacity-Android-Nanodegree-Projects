### POPULAR MOVIES, STAGE 1 and POPULAR MOVIES, STAGE 2

- You will fetch data from the Internet with the [MovieDB API](https://www.themoviedb.org/).
- You will use adapters and custom list layouts to populate list views.
- You will incorporate libraries to simplify the amount of code you need to write
- Present the user with a grid arrangement of movie posters upon launch.

* Allow your user to change sort order via a setting: \* The sort order can be by most popular or by highest-rated
* Allow the user to tap on a movie poster and transition to a details screen with additional information such as:
  original title

  - movie poster image thumbnail
  - A plot synopsis (called overview in the api)
  - user rating (called vote_average in the api)
  - release date

* You’ll allow users to view and play trailers (either in the youtube app or a web browser).
* You’ll allow users to read reviews of a selected movie.
* You’ll also allow users to mark a movie as a favorite in the details view by tapping a button (star).
* You'll make use of Android Architecture Components (Room, LiveData, ViewModel and Lifecycle) to create a robust an efficient application.
* You'll create a database using Room to store the names and ids of the user's favorite movies (and optionally, the rest of the information needed to display their favorites collection while offline).
* You’ll modify the existing sorting criteria for the main view to include an additional pivot to show their favorites collection.
